Hi, this my personal website. I am working for inventive, unique, and inspiring designs and recording it here.

About me

My name is Ali. I am studying Mechanical Engineering at Eskisehir Osmangazi University, also I am a member of Mavera Technology Team who competes at Efficiency Challenge Electric Vehicle competition which is an annual competition for universities organized by TÜBİTAK since 2005. The competition takes place each summer in Turkey and aims to create awareness of alternative energy use, to raise university students’ capability to put their knowledge into practice and to work across disciplinary boundaries.
