I am working for indigeneous, unique, and inspiring designs.

About me
======
My name is Ali. I am studying Mechanical Engineering at Eskisehir Osmangazi University, also I am a member of Mavera Technology Team who competes at Efficiency Challenge Electric Vehicle competition which is an annual competition for universities organized by TÜBİTAK since 2005. The competition takes place each summer in Turkey and aims to create awareness of alternative energy use, to raise university students’ capability to put their knowledge into practice and to work across disciplinary boundaries. 



In project scope I designed the vehicle's exterior body, analyzed it and optimized the design according to the drag coefficient (Cd). In addition, I made researches on composite production in the production process of the exterior body and took action in composite production. Our team participates in the contest for the second time.

I have also worked at various production companies, You can find more information about me in the CV tab.
